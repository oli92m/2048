# 2048
This is a 2048 game that I coded during a rainy Fall weekend.

The movement keys are set at the beginning of each session so it's playable on all type of keyboard.

The code could certainly get faster since I use a lot of for loop in the code but I wanted to work with a serious time constraint on this project. I've tried to create a maximum of subdivision to make the code more readable (e.g. all the movement functions, the sum functions...).
